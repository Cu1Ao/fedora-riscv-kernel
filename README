The Linux kernel for the Fedora/RISC-V project.
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/RISC-V

This is NOT the Linux kernel itself.  It is the build script and a few
patches which we use to build the Linux kernel for the Fedora/RISC-V
project.

The actual Linux kernel source comes from the following fork:
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-linux

Requirements:

 - Fedora 24+ (eg. x86_64) host.

 - The cross-compiler toolchain.  We don't package this, but you can
   either build it yourself or get it from
   https://github.com/rwmjones/fedora-riscv-bootstrap

Build the kernel:

 - Run 'make'

The result is the 'vmlinux' file.  Note we do not use modules.

Test the kernel:

 - Get a stage4 disk image, for example from
   https://fedorapeople.org/groups/risc-v/

 - Get qemu-system-riscv from:

     dnf copr enable rjones/riscv
     dnf install riscv-qemu

 - Run 'make boot-stage4-in-qemu'
