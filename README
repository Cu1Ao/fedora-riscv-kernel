The Linux kernel for the Fedora/RISC-V project.
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/RISC-V

This is NOT the Linux kernel itself.  It is the build script and a few
patches which we use to build the Linux kernel for the Fedora/RISC-V
project.

The actual Linux kernel source comes from the following fork:
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-linux

NB: This must be run on an existing Fedora/RISC-V build host or VM.
It cannot be cross-compiled.

Requirements:

 - Fedora/RISC-V
   see: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/RISC-V
        https://fedorapeople.org/groups/risc-v/disk-images/

 - Install the kernel dependencies into the VM environment.  One
   way is to run 'dnf builddep kernel.spec'

Build the kernel:

 - Run 'make'

The result is the 'bbl' file.  Note we do not use modules.

Test the kernel:

 - Get a stage4 disk image, for example from
   https://fedorapeople.org/groups/risc-v/

 - Get qemu-system-riscv64.

 - Run 'make boot-stage4-in-qemu'
